**Custom Fork of Escalade's LibreELEC build with Support for NVIDIA Legacy Video Cards supported by 304.135**
* Replaced 340.102 driver with 304.135

**Planned**
* Add 304.135 as a separate driver to build alongside 340.102 for additional support

Original README.MD from Escalade is below.

**A fork of LibreELEC with the following features:**
* LibreELEC 8.0 git
* Kodi 17 Krypton git
* Docker 1.11.1
* Emulationstation (Herdinger fork) + sselph scraper
* RetroArch git
* VICE 2.4.24
* UAE4ARM/FS-UAE git
* F2FS/BTRFS/XFS filesystem support
* RPi3 Bluetooth working out of the box
* UNFS3 NFS server

**Build command**
```
# PROJECT=Generic ARCH=x86_64 make image
or
# PROJECT=RPi2 ARCH=arm make image
```

**Reformat /storage to F2FS on next boot**
```
# touch /storage/.please_reformat_f2fs
```

**Automatically backup/restore while reformatting:**
```
# touch /storage/.backup
```

**Switch between EmulationStation and RetroArch as the emulator frontend**
```
# edit /storage/.config/emulator-frontend.conf
```

**Emulationstation arguments in /storage/.config/emulationstation/emulationstation.conf**
```
EMULATIONSTATION_OPTS="--ignore-gamelist --no-splash"
```

**Docker arguments in /storage/.config/docker/docker.conf**
```
DOCKER_DAEMON_OPTS="--graph=/storage/.docker"
DOCKER_STORAGE_OPTS="--storage-driver=overlay"
```

**Out of the box Emulationstation will look for roms in /storage/roms/(amiga|c64|mame|fba|gba|dreamcast|n64|psx|psp|saturn|snes|nes|nds). BIOS files should be put in /storage/roms/bios. Configured input controllers are DS4 (bluetooth) and keyboard. Configuration is in /storage/.config/emulationstation. The keyboard layout is as follows:**

```
Navigation = Arrow keys
A = Enter
B = Backspace
Page up = ,
Page down = .
Start = rctrl
Select = ralt
```

**Keyboard buttons in different apps**
```
Kodi shutdown menu = S
Kodi context menu = C
Emulationstation menu = RCTRL
uae4arm menu = F12
uae4arm joystick/mouse switch = F11
VICE menu = F12
Retroarch menu = F1
```
